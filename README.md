## Hello there

I'm meghub - junior fullstack developer

I am currently working on my coding skills (MERN-Stack)

One goal for the future is to be part of the opensource community

### Scrolling through my repositories, i hope you find some:
- improvements through my learning journey
- a little bit of entertainment
- maybe even well coded projects?  _I'm always open for feedback!_

I enjoy collaborating, if there is anything i can help you with: Let me know!

### Random fact about me:

- I like ramen, puzzles and debugging
